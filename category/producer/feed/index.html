				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>What skills and qualities are needed to be a good video producer? Juice’s Becca Dymock shares her thoughts, experience and top tips…</p>
<h2>Be prepared</h2>
<p>For me, preparation is key. You have to be organised. Make sure all aspects of the shoot are agreed and signed off by the client before you arrive on location.</p>
<p>Remember that changes to wardrobe, props and scripts will delay shooting. This inevitably costs time and money (and tends to annoy the Director). While spur of the moment changes will always be likely, it is best to try and keep them minimal – or at least have ready-made back up plans for potential, foreseeable problems.</p>
<h2>Learn from others</h2>
<p>So much of what makes a good producer is about learning from those who know more than you. I had a couple of fantastic mentors when I started out who gave me just the right amount of responsibility. They gave me space to grow and learn from the odd mistake – whilst stopping me from making costly ones!</p>
<p>I do remember some other ‘questionable’ mentoring however. In one particular temp job I had as a fledgling production assistant, I asked the producer if she could help me when applying for child licenses. With her feet up on a table reading a book she replied, “Darling I wouldn’t have a clue, I haven’t been a PA for 12 years”. I’m not sure she even looked up.</p>
<h2>Know your team</h2>
<p>Gathering the right people and setting the tone of the production is paramount. Knowing upfront which Directors/Editors are right for the creative treatment is absolutely essential. We’re all there for a common cause, to get the best output for the client, and we can only do that if everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p>Knowing the people you work with and understanding their craft is key to having a smooth shoot. At the start of a project, you need to ask yourself what skillset does your team need in order to bring the creative vision to life.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>You really need to be a good communicator. With a looming air date or deadline, you need to move fast to get all those necessary approvals and that requires respectful but determined communication. Setting out and sharing your key milestones in advance will help everyone know what is expected of them, and when by. This helps keep the project on time and in budget.</p>
<h2>Negotiation</h2>
<p>No getting around it, budgets aren’t what they used to be. As the belts tighten, producers need to be great negotiators. You’ll need to prioritise multiple expectations whilst keeping the budget on track.</p>
<p>You need to be able to ballpark costs by just looking at a script. Knowing what’s possible for the money up front helps to manage expectations and lead the project in the right direction from the start. No one wants to be discussing overtime with the crew at 2am on an unscheduled night shoot.</p>
<h2>Stay relevant</h2>
<p>Even though you don’t need to know it all, it’s a good idea to keep up to date on latest creative technology. I’m a facilitator and it’s my job to know what’s available and then gather the experts that can deliver those technologies in order to achieve our creative goals. Don’t be a luddite.</p>
<h2>Respect everyone</h2>
<p>I started as runner and worked my way up. Whilst working in a Post House somewhere on Wardour St a client gave me a dressing down at 2am for bringing her a baked potato with butter ‘on’ the potato not on the side. I was a bit perturbed to say the least.</p>
<p>Consequently, I always treat everyone on set with respect. Please and thank you should never be under-estimated, whether it’s your Director going the extra mile for the client or a cup of tea and a biscuit delivered by the runner, being polite doesn’t cost a thing but makes everyone feel valued and usually results in a better end product.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">When tasked with creating a new digital tool for customers, it’s easy to get caught up in internal priorities.<br />
You might be focused on your own personal KPIs, what the Marketing team would like it to achieve or what your line manager demands in terms of growth and targets.</p>
<p>And while a collection of objectives seems like a sensible blueprint to start from, after processing the various departmental opinions and preferences, the project can quickly spiral out of control.</p>
<p>Maybe the boss has seen a pretty nifty site somewhere that has loads of animations and simply wants your build to echo that. Or marketing insist it should work in a different way, and give you a wildly different direction to follow before agreeing your original concept was better.</p>
<p>Maybe just hold on a minute, take a breath and ask yourself – what are you actually trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Is it brand awareness? Lead generation? Sales conversion?</p>
<p>And what are we using to measure success? Site visits? Dwell time? Conversions? Specific event interaction?</p>
<p>Or maybe it should be simple metrics around customer engagement. They’re the users remember.</p>
<p>Oh yes, them!</p>
<p>Because unless you’re carefully considering your user’s needs and looking at everything through that lens, you’re going to have a problem. They are the focus.</p>
<p>Who really wants to face the criticism of why people ‘simply aren’t engaging with the platform’, why they aren’t converting down the sales funnel or why they seem to close the application down as soon as they’ve opened it.</p>
<p>Your users have the ultimate power to disengage and find a better experience elsewhere immediately.</p>
<p>Like any high street, if you’ve an ugly and out of touch shop window you’re unlikely to get any footfall.</p>
<p>Even if you do get them through the door they are going to leave permanently if the experience is clunky, disorganised and unhelpful.</p>
<p>With this in mind, doesn’t it make sense to talk your customers before you design your shop?</p>
<p>Perhaps find out what they like and expect, what bothers them and what they are missing from other experiences.</p>
<p>You actually already know this, even if subconsciously. You’re a customer. We all are.</p>
<p>We’re the real experts in digital experience because we live it every day. We know what bugs us, frustrates us and what a smooth, hassle free experience looks and feels like.</p>
<p>You’re a human experiencing a digital world.</p>
<p>So don’t forget yourself, or others like you, when creating a new one.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>Tips for creating a great digital human experience</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Do some user research</h3>
<p>Literally work with an agency or conduct the research yourself. Talk to a broad cross section of your target demographic, find out the problems they face, what’s frustrating, what they want to do, how long they need to do it, and where they do it from.</p>
<h3>Hire User Experience expertise – and listen to it!</h3>
<p>A good UX designer will already be very aware of the business objectives of a digital experience project and knows the best way to get users from A to B. They will have seen where and why applications fail many times before and know how to smooth the path and remove the obstacles. You’ve paid for their knowledge, so listen to it.</p>
<h3>A/B test</h3>
<p>Not sure which approach will work best? Really want to get this right? Be patient and let the data tell you. Produce multiple approaches and measure the results. Your users and the data will tell you what works best.</p>
<h3>Engaging User Interface design</h3>
<p>It’s not just the imagery or the buttons, it’s all the bits in between. It’s what happens when you hover over an image, how the page animates when you scroll down, the feel of a good online experience. The third dimension.</p>
<h3>Always evolve</h3>
<p>You followed points 1 to 4 religiously 18 months ago but it’s time to review. A year is a long time in digital, trends move on and so subconsciously do our tastes. That kitchen your friend put in four years ago, who uses ceramic hobs now? If you want to stay relevant, continue to invest.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>I love my job and like to think I’m pretty experienced by now.</p>
<p>Aware, alert and able to divert from most potential red flags, but March 2020 like millions of others saw the Juice film team suddenly relocate to kitchen tables, dining rooms and kid’s bedrooms… all somewhere off the M4 corridor. Working from home, producing from Teams and slightly off course from the warm streets of Lyon which had been the location for our next Juice shoot.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of an era that probably most haven’t experienced in a lifetime and one I really didn’t see coming. A time when the film industry momentarily came to a grinding halt, took stock and drew breath before tearing up the production process as we had known it to move into a new age of filming safely in a pandemic.</p>
<p>As my first COVID era shoot loomed, I for one thought I had these new COVID procedures down pat. No problem I thought! It’s a producers’ job to iron out the creases and keep it all on track.</p>
<p>APA declaration form signed. PPE purchased, extra monitors on set, NHS check-in QR code laminated and approved COVID personnel on set. What could go wrong? Well, quite a bit as it happens…</p>
<p>It started at 6pm on the evening before the shoot with a phone call from the talent agency. “Sorry, your main actress won’t be turning up, she’s on another job today and her acting partner has tested positive for COVID&#8221;.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>&#8220;But don’t panic we’ve found someone else last minute that fits the casting brief”.</p>
<p>Phew! Disaster diverted.</p>
<p>New talent approved; call sheet adjusted; release form amended. It’s all systems&#8230;Umm no go apparently!</p>
<p>Our in-house cameraman calls, (who incidentally handled all of the kit loading into the van). “I&#8217;m so sorry but my flatmate has just tested positive for COVID and we’re all having to self- isolate”.</p>
<p>Wow, this is much trickier than I’d thought.</p>
<p>Frantic calls follow as I try to locate a new cameraman at short notice. By 9pm I had one on board and we were back on track.</p>
<p>Breathe…</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The night shoot is upon us and while myself and Alan have to disinfect and repack every piece of shoot kit our original cameraman handled &#8211; at least I&#8217;m on my way.</span></p>
<p>But not before another curveball.</p>
<p>The talent agency was fabulous at finding a new actress quickly, but not quite so great at informing me of her different dress size. A quick dash into a retail park on route to buy a whole new wardrobe and I’m on my way…again!</p>
<p>As I leave the drama behind me on the A40 I reach the set and wonder what this new world of social distancing, masks and constant sanitising has in store for me over the next two nights.</p>
<p>Turns out I needn’t have worried. As the Director shouts “Action” from a petrol station forecourt at 10pm, I’m conscious of one thing…</p>
<p>Whether it’s talent no shows, last-minute phone calls or wardrobe mishaps, we producers love a challenge…. at the end of the day, it’s just a night shoot.</p>
<p>No problem!</p></div>
