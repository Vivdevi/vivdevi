				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">Last year we might have committed to not doing it again. Yes, the slightly weary, charity-driven Juice Christmas initiative. Never again we said. Hopefully. And yes, here we are in Remarkable Year #2. Really sorry about that.</p>
<p>With so much ‘need’ out there it was finally decided that without a planet we can comfortably exist on everything else pretty much kind of pales. So with the help of our friends (and client) The National Trust we are committing to planting a tree for every invoice we send out in 2022. Or rather we are asking them to. We are a bit busy to be digging away in our Hunter wellies with a fork from the office cutlery drawer – plus we don’t own any land although we do have a veg planter out the back at Juice Towers, excellent for herbs, not so much for mighty oaks. We hope we can plant at least 500 trees between us. That’s many. A small Juice forest (or at least a nice copse, a thicket or maybe a clump). Munching CO2 every day.</p>
<p>So this next year every invoice we send is actually a tree in disguise.</p>
<p>Make us busier. Plant more trees. A nicer planet. Simple. And stay safe.</p>
<p>Happy Christmas.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Tuesday 30th November 2021</strong> &#8211; Juice, the brand engagement agency, has acquired branding and design agency The Frank Agency. The development complements Juice’s accelerated growth strategy, strengthens in-house skillsets, extends service offerings, and supports growing demand for end-to-end creative service providers.</p>
<p>Alan Poole, Juice Managing Director and Founder said, ‘Truly great acquisition opportunities are pretty rare so when Jim approached me a few months back it became clear pretty quickly that their reputation, skills and stellar existing client portfolio made ‘Frank’ a natural fit for our growth plans’.</p>
<p>‘Over the last few years we have built a ‘digital-first’ brand engagement agency – designing innovative ways to engage colleague and customer audiences across the online landscape. Demand for this of course has only accelerated in the last tricky couple of years and so the chance to enhance our team by bringing in ‘Frank’ and their exceptional people into Juice, whilst significantly enhancing our strategic and brand skills, was too good to pass up’.</p>
<p>Since 2000 ‘Frank’ has been known for delivering brand identity and campaign work for clients such as INEOS Grenadier, Dunlop and Reaction Engines. For Managing Director and Founder Jim Gilroy, the move opens exciting doors for both new and existing clients.</p>
<p>‘Juice and Frank are two businesses that ‘just match’. Over the years we have both independently built loyal client bases in the automotive, engineering and emerging technology markets. By blending our branding, strategy and creative expertise with Juice’s digital production capabilities we have created an even stronger proposition for these sectors and new ones we want to enter. We’ve actually worked on projects jointly in the not-too-distant past so to formalise that relationship now feels like a great move, both for the clients and the respective creative teams’.</p>
<p>The acquisition brings Frank team members in under the Juice umbrella and has forged a new identity for the agency.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">Design trends are ever on the move, they have to be. In a world obsessed with visual representation, consumers are becoming more and more aware of how they’re being communicated to by brands.</p>
<p>Enter Gen Viz. This psychographic (need help with that word? It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychographic">here</a>) macro-trend describes young teens who rely on realism, authenticity and most importantly; championing a visual-first culture. Is it not surprising then, that this generation of kids has forged ahead, constructing unique identities for themselves inspired by visual styles from the past?</p>
<p>As designers, we are responding to this race for realness and the struggle for ultimate authenticity. We’re seeing a shift that is moving away from the “new, new” backwards towards design languages of the 70s, 80s and 90s. More specifically our 80s influence today is deeply rooted in the computer-generated graphics of the era: think early Nintendo gaming systems with bright, blocky shapes.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll look at the how and why of this hyper-visual design trend commonly described as: ‘Modern-Retro’.</p>
<p><strong>‘Walking in Memphis’.</strong></p>
<p>Form and structure are two styles closely linked with art in the 80s. Think furniture design, silhouettes in fashion and gaming but specifically, think the Memphis Design movement (handy additional pictures <a href="https://designmuseum.org/memphis">here</a>). Bright colours, cartoon-like shapes and fluid lines make up the fundamental building blocks of this artistic style, and it’s back with a vengeance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4683" style="width: 1630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4683" class="wp-image-4683 size-full" src="https://www.itsjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Bobby_Doherty_WillByrant_FB.jpg" alt="" width="1620" height="800" /><p id="caption-attachment-4683" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Bobby Doherty/New York Magazine. Facebook office, Texas, photo: Will Byrant.</p></div></p>
<p>In the images, the resemblance between 80s object design and a modern wall mural by artist Will Byrant is striking; from the use of colour, to the shapes adopted and the playful nature of the piece.</p>
<p><strong>Colour Pop.</strong></p>
<p>Bold colours belong on screens. Again think 80s computer games and Miami Vice. More and more design is taking influence from RGB colours and translating them into poppy process versions instead. In the examples below, an advertising campaign for online dating app OKcupid, Weiden + Kennedy New York adopted an 80s aesthetic to convey a very modern message in dating culture. The visuals nod nicely to Gen Viz; with messages grounded in authenticity and personality which is largely owed to the photographic style resembling works by Guy Bourdin, notably between 1967 and 1981 when he shot ad campaigns for shoe designer Charles Jourdan. Mysterious compositions, bright and blocky backgrounds make the output unquestionably retro and combined with central themes around online dating make for a very juxtaposing but pleasing combination.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4675" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4675" class="wp-image-4675 size-large" src="https://www.itsjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/OKcupid_Campaign-1024x662.png" alt="" width="1024" height="662" /><p id="caption-attachment-4675" class="wp-caption-text">Image from OKcupid campaign</p></div></p>
<p>Colour is so important in communication. Invariably your brand will use a pre-defined palette designed to best communicate your organisation’s proposition and value to its customers. But what if your message needs more vibrant hues like the example below? It’s got to be OK for a brand to ‘bend’ from time-to-time and show a sense of awareness. Think long term too; how will your brand palette stack up in five or ten years time when Gen Viz become your customers, employees or partners?</p>
<p><strong>Layer Up.</strong></p>
<p>The Modern-Retro movement employs the use of multi-faceted design, often layering shapes, images and colours together to create one visual composition. This style is popular in both print and digital applications creating impact and engagement. It also creates energy in a world of fast-paced online consumption where we want things immediately whether it be news, images, education or social updates. It’s not surprising that we’re serving content up in an energetic way to keep up with consumption rates. Layering isn’t new. But the way we’re layering imagery and styles today has become more obvious, less organic and more about making a statement. Think about how you could try combining brand imagery with supplementary ‘mood’ images, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4689" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4689" class="wp-image-4689 size-large" src="https://www.itsjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Grid-Images-1024x809.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="809" /><p id="caption-attachment-4689" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Top left and lower right: Serge Vasil for Adobe, top right: notebooks from Write &amp; Sketch, lower left: image from Mui Mui spring summer 2018 campaign.</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Science Fiction.</strong></p>
<p>Cue the phenomenon that is Stranger Things.  Its 80s styling is prevalent across its use of fashion, sets, neon typography and comic book style illustrations, not to mention the blatant nod to numerous Sci-Fi films from the 80s. Would the show have worked as well without all of its nostalgic references? (No, is the answer to that question in case you didn’t know). Why are so many young people engaging in a cultural era they have barely lived through, let alone remember? We’re not suggesting to remake E.T. here but the point is cultural reference. The Juice designers live for persona research, it helps us to focus a design style and to select the most appropriate application for any given message. So, before you start your next project, immerse yourself (and us) in your audience’s world and ask yourself, how can I make my work grab them? What points of cultural reference will make my message resonate more profoundly with my consumers?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4690" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4690" class="wp-image-4690 size-large" src="https://www.itsjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/StrangerThings_Netflix_Collage_01-1024x336.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="336" /><p id="caption-attachment-4690" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Netflix</p></div></p>
<p><strong>That’s a Wrap.</strong></p>
<p>From fashion to material design, to pop culture and television, the 80s is definitely enjoying a revival seeping through into every aspect of design. Is this coincidence or is it a backlash to common cultural and political influences; perhaps we’re just trying to lighten the mood? Or is it directly a result of Gen Viz, the group of young social activists striving for the ultimate in authenticity and living every day through a hypervisual lens? Maybe we won’t know. Maybe it’s enough just to appreciate this fun and engaging visual style, regardless of influence. You decide. And, if it’s right, be brave.</div>
