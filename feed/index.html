				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">Last year we might have committed to not doing it again. Yes, the slightly weary, charity-driven Juice Christmas initiative. Never again we said. Hopefully. And yes, here we are in Remarkable Year #2. Really sorry about that.</p>
<p>With so much ‘need’ out there it was finally decided that without a planet we can comfortably exist on everything else pretty much kind of pales. So with the help of our friends (and client) The National Trust we are committing to planting a tree for every invoice we send out in 2022. Or rather we are asking them to. We are a bit busy to be digging away in our Hunter wellies with a fork from the office cutlery drawer – plus we don’t own any land although we do have a veg planter out the back at Juice Towers, excellent for herbs, not so much for mighty oaks. We hope we can plant at least 500 trees between us. That’s many. A small Juice forest (or at least a nice copse, a thicket or maybe a clump). Munching CO2 every day.</p>
<p>So this next year every invoice we send is actually a tree in disguise.</p>
<p>Make us busier. Plant more trees. A nicer planet. Simple. And stay safe.</p>
<p>Happy Christmas.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Tuesday 30th November 2021</strong> &#8211; Juice, the brand engagement agency, has acquired branding and design agency The Frank Agency. The development complements Juice’s accelerated growth strategy, strengthens in-house skillsets, extends service offerings, and supports growing demand for end-to-end creative service providers.</p>
<p>Alan Poole, Juice Managing Director and Founder said, ‘Truly great acquisition opportunities are pretty rare so when Jim approached me a few months back it became clear pretty quickly that their reputation, skills and stellar existing client portfolio made ‘Frank’ a natural fit for our growth plans’.</p>
<p>‘Over the last few years we have built a ‘digital-first’ brand engagement agency – designing innovative ways to engage colleague and customer audiences across the online landscape. Demand for this of course has only accelerated in the last tricky couple of years and so the chance to enhance our team by bringing in ‘Frank’ and their exceptional people into Juice, whilst significantly enhancing our strategic and brand skills, was too good to pass up’.</p>
<p>Since 2000 ‘Frank’ has been known for delivering brand identity and campaign work for clients such as INEOS Grenadier, Dunlop and Reaction Engines. For Managing Director and Founder Jim Gilroy, the move opens exciting doors for both new and existing clients.</p>
<p>‘Juice and Frank are two businesses that ‘just match’. Over the years we have both independently built loyal client bases in the automotive, engineering and emerging technology markets. By blending our branding, strategy and creative expertise with Juice’s digital production capabilities we have created an even stronger proposition for these sectors and new ones we want to enter. We’ve actually worked on projects jointly in the not-too-distant past so to formalise that relationship now feels like a great move, both for the clients and the respective creative teams’.</p>
<p>The acquisition brings Frank team members in under the Juice umbrella and has forged a new identity for the agency.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>At some point earlier this month we celebrated our 20th birthday. It&#8217;s still hard to believe. Juice has been going a whole 20 years!</p>
<p>To prove that this is in fact true, we asked our founder and MD, Alan Poole, to regale some stories of yore, looking back at the challenges, key wins and lessons learned from running a creative agency for over two decades.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>We are 20</h2>
<p>’They’ said…</p>
<p>“AP, write something about how Juice is 20 this year. Tell everyone how it began, how you’ve made it, what you’ve learnt etc. But don’t waffle on like you normally would. Oh, and get it done by mid-August so we can publish it in time for the anniversary in early September.”</p>
<p>September 30th.</p>
<h2>In the beginning…</h2>
<p>Juice was a mistake.</p>
<p>OK, maybe not the greatest opening line of a short piece to celebrate 20 glorious years (well, about 18 glorious ones and a couple of slightly crap ones).</p>
<p>Perhaps ‘Juice wasn’t the plan’ is a better opener.</p>
<p>It only really exists as a result of my inability to find a decent, honourable and interesting employer to work for. At the time, all those years back, I wasn’t especially bothered by the ‘creative’ industry. I was testing a few other career avenues first – trucks, ice cream, even Teletubbies bubble bath (a tragic low point for sure).</p>
<p>I worked for a couple of good people and companies but didn’t feel especially fulfilled. Looking back, it wasn’t until I founded Juice that I felt like I had finally found my ‘home’ &#8211; surrounded by people much cleverer and more creative than me. But like all good things, finding it required a bit of a hop, or maybe a gigantic leap would be better terminology. Especially after I walked out of my last ‘employed’ job with nowhere to go and three months from being a dad for the first time.</p>
<h2>Early days…</h2>
<p>I sold my car, a silver Fiesta I really liked, sad – went to the local car auction, bought something cheap and unwieldy for a third of the cash and spent the rest on a Macbook (special mention to Apple – for you have been comprehensively rinsing us for all those beautiful devices for 20 years). I also bought one of those all-in-one, printer/scanner/copier/fax things that lasted about a year before one of the key functions – probably the printer – ceased to work. And then Juice … was a thing &#8211; in my spare bedroom with a crying baby next door. The original ‘work from home’. Literally.</p>
<p>We were a video production business (at least that’s what we told people). And for that I must largely credit my first partner in crime, Deane Thrussell. Deane was one of those guys (and still is) who could make a fully functioning edit suite out of a takeaway coffee cup, a ball of string and a small rodent. He would create magic whilst I duplicated DVDs all weekend on the kitchen table. Our one-MacBook-and-a-fax-machine business punched way above our weight but we worked, and worked, and worked, and drank a lot of increasingly excellent coffee to deliver for our first small collection of clients (Castrol BP was the very first and is still one today). In 20 years that attitude remains embedded in the DNA of this company. And we’re certainly known for our coffee.</p>
<h2>This seems to be working…</h2>
<p>The digital ‘arm’ of the business followed a few years later (again, formed by another bunch of people much cleverer than me). Our first ‘big fish’ being Williams Formula One and Accenture. I pulled together a team of enthusiastic and very talented freelancers. They seemed to like working with us, they stayed, and so built our fledgling digital business from nothing.</p>
<p>Of course, we have had many moments of stress, strain and humour over the years – like early on when the VP of a major client awarded us a project that ran into many £’000’s – a big deal for us at the time. He came down to the farm to check on progress and upon walking in, seeing all 5 of us, famously said ‘where the hell are the rest of you?’. 16 years later that client is still with us.</p>
<p>Or when we were developing our new offices. The bank manager came round, saw the scale of what we were building and said with a smile, ‘you’ll go bust’. We changed banks.</p>
<p>I always believed that we could go toe-to-toe with London. I refused to accept that creative excellence only existed within the five streets of W1. I find it especially ironic now that the message seems to be that ‘great work can be done anywhere’. Well, we were 20 years ahead of you all on that one!</p>
<p>Overall, we’ve done more things right than wrong, but we’ve never been good at shouting about it &#8211; we’re too busy – those awards forms are so tedious. Perhaps now that we’re 20, we might start entering some…I’m told ‘it’s a good thing’.</p>
<h2>Great clients make great work easy…</h2>
<p>We’ve worked with some incredible clients and people over the years. It’s said that you can’t claim to be true ‘partners’ unless you have a financial tie-in. That’s junk. It demands a mindset, and real actions on both ‘sides’ – get that right and we can all pull in the same, results led direction.</p>
<p>For me, it’s not that complicated. We stick to our principles. We won’t just work with anyone. Clients need to share our basic, collaborative beliefs. If you think we are &#8216;just a supplier&#8217; – you’ll be disappointed. Our people, and their talents, deserve better than that.</p>
<p>I always felt that if we work hard at the basic stuff &#8211; paying people on time, being straightforward to deal with, being loyal, sharing success – we would be just fine. If you can do no more, sleepless nights won’t follow.</p>
<p>We work hard to treat our contractors, suppliers and freelancers &#8211; many of whom have been making us look brilliant for years &#8211; as if they are full-time Juicers. We’re always grateful, knowing you could do the same amazing things elsewhere, but you still often chose to do it with us over them. Thank you.</p>
<h2>Our people</h2>
<p>And to the Juice team members &#8211; who have, of course, changed over the years (although several are headed for the long service award – a Covid booster). You are, by a million miles, the single most important reason for our success and reputation.</p>
<p>We work hard every day to try to do right by you, inspire you and find you great projects to work on that you can be rightly proud of.</p>
<p>You. Are. Amazing.</p>
<p>As my elderly mum said when she came to Juice Towers (which is a pretty nice place if you’ve never been), ‘when are you going to get a proper job?’. These words are immortalised on one of the walls of our office. If your mum can’t keep you humble and grounded, then who can?</p>
<p>One day I might take her advice – that supermarket van delivery driving job awaits &#8211; but we have lots to do before then.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>Work hard</h2>
<p>An old but accurate cliche.</p>
<p>The ‘creative industry’ is highly competitive. It is viewed as one of the most fun, creative and artistic jobs you can actually make a decent living from. The realities are not always what you imagined but if it pays your rent, count yourself one of the lucky ones. Very few people I went to university with ended up using their degree.</p>
<p>If you want to ‘make it’ in this business, be prepared to work harder than everyone else in the room, regardless of natural ability.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that you will freelance for most of your career. Whilst this offers you an element of freedom it does unfortunately make you somewhat of a commodity. You are entirely replaceable without the luxury to coast through jobs.</p>
<p>Since my early years of freelancing, I have been lucky enough earn full-time employment positions. However, I am now hard-wired to believe you are only as good as your last VT. Every piece of work you put out must be, at least in your mind, your best work yet.</p>
<p>And this habit of working hard goes beyond your own role in a production. Put in some extra time to make the producer, director, and even the tea boy’s life easier.</p>
<p>Offer to help at the expense of your own downtime. Go out of your way to train people, discuss their work and offer feedback.</p>
<p>It could be tomorrow or in ten years time, but that person you helped could recommend you for the biggest job of your life.</p>
<h2>Be a technical expert</h2>
<p>Be studious about the technicalities of your craft.</p>
<p>A lot of researchers, producers and directors can edit but most of them don’t have the time or interest to learn the latest technologies.</p>
<p>Knowing your software inside out helps you work more efficiently (something every client/producer appreciates). With the technical part happening effortlessly, you release more time for the creative (fun) bit of editing.</p>
<p>It pays to keep an eye on future software releases. New kit is released all the time and quickly adopted as industry standard. Knowing it better than anyone else, and what else is around the corner, increases your value.</p>
<h2>Try on all hats of film making</h2>
<p>Don’t just edit, make your own projects.</p>
<p>Shoot, direct, produce, write.</p>
<p>If you play an instrument, learn about audio engineering. Compose. Mix. It all helps.</p>
<p>Look to gain perspective on other people’s job roles and how a project comes together. This gives you empathy with your team, which is hugely important in problem solving and selling the final product.</p>
<p>Throughout my career I have dipped my toe in every pond. I have learned how to light shoots, operate camera, colour grade, create motion graphics…</p>
<p>Try to wear as many hats as possible, at least at the start of your professional journey. Whilst you may want to progress as an editor, having a good foundational knowledge of all filmmaking departments will benefit you. Everything I have learned in film making informs my editing decisions.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>Be selective (eventually)</h2>
<p>Even though the goal is to move from ‘video generalist’ to editor, you will eventually need to specialise even further.</p>
<p>Starting out, try your hand at many different styles of film. Cut short films, long films, 30 second clips, 1 minute clips etc.</p>
<p>But when you learn what you enjoy most, make that your niche and have your showreel reflect it.</p>
<p>If you currently make lots of corporate videos, but you want to edit feature films, only show off work that is relevant. This may mean going out and shooting your own feature pieces first.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to show off your ‘range’ but big producers don’t like to take chances on generalists &#8211; they like safe bets. And who can blame them when it’s their reputation on the line!</p>
<p>I have heard of Directors of Photography who shoot food being turned down for ice cream ads because they haven’t shot the relevant flavour before. “So, you have strawberry on your reel but no chocolate?”</p>
<h2>Be sociable</h2>
<p>Talent aside, most work recommendations throughout your career will come from being a nice, amenable person to work with.</p>
<p>The industry is small and people will remember you &#8211; especially if you act like a dick. Treat others how you like to be treated. It sounds obvious but so many people forget it.</p>
<p>In general, editors are ‘below the line’ and not important enough to be able to get away with being a ‘screamer’ or ‘difficult to work with’. Be respectful to even the lowest person in a production, you never know someone’s career trajectory &#8211; they may become your producer one day!</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that editing is one of the more time-intensive jobs in video production. People have to sit in a room with you for long periods of time. I know many employers who will hire someone they get on with over a more experienced person they can’t stand to be around.</p>
<h2>Develop a thick skin</h2>
<p>You can’t afford to be too sensitive in this business.</p>
<p>It is a stressful industry where a lot of important players are time poor. They don’t always have the bandwidth to consider other people’s feelings.</p>
<p>Don’t take rants and raves too personally. You will inevitably face criticism of your art, and thus your worth, at some point. Some of it will be valid, some perhaps not, but you should take feedback on the chin and remember who the boss is. Every producer or client has personal preferences.</p>
<p>At first, new clients or less experienced executives might not know what they want from a video edit. Take time to build a rapport with them. Get to know their quirks. Developing an understanding early on can save a lot of time and heartache in the long run.<span style="font-size: 18px;"> </span></div>

<p>Ultimately, your job is to deliver for the client.</p>
<p>At any time be prepared for them to change the brief, the duration, the concept, pause or even scrap the project entirely. Things can change fast.</p>
<p>If there is indecision from the senior creatives, don’t be afraid to put your own ideas forward. Film making is a collaborative process of different perspectives. In my experience, the best producers and directors will listen to all view points and then use the best idea in the room.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>What skills and qualities are needed to be a good video producer? Juice’s Becca Dymock shares her thoughts, experience and top tips…</p>
<h2>Be prepared</h2>
<p>For me, preparation is key. You have to be organised. Make sure all aspects of the shoot are agreed and signed off by the client before you arrive on location.</p>
<p>Remember that changes to wardrobe, props and scripts will delay shooting. This inevitably costs time and money (and tends to annoy the Director). While spur of the moment changes will always be likely, it is best to try and keep them minimal – or at least have ready-made back up plans for potential, foreseeable problems.</p>
<h2>Learn from others</h2>
<p>So much of what makes a good producer is about learning from those who know more than you. I had a couple of fantastic mentors when I started out who gave me just the right amount of responsibility. They gave me space to grow and learn from the odd mistake – whilst stopping me from making costly ones!</p>
<p>I do remember some other ‘questionable’ mentoring however. In one particular temp job I had as a fledgling production assistant, I asked the producer if she could help me when applying for child licenses. With her feet up on a table reading a book she replied, “Darling I wouldn’t have a clue, I haven’t been a PA for 12 years”. I’m not sure she even looked up.</p>
<h2>Know your team</h2>
<p>Gathering the right people and setting the tone of the production is paramount. Knowing upfront which Directors/Editors are right for the creative treatment is absolutely essential. We’re all there for a common cause, to get the best output for the client, and we can only do that if everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p>Knowing the people you work with and understanding their craft is key to having a smooth shoot. At the start of a project, you need to ask yourself what skillset does your team need in order to bring the creative vision to life.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>You really need to be a good communicator. With a looming air date or deadline, you need to move fast to get all those necessary approvals and that requires respectful but determined communication. Setting out and sharing your key milestones in advance will help everyone know what is expected of them, and when by. This helps keep the project on time and in budget.</p>
<h2>Negotiation</h2>
<p>No getting around it, budgets aren’t what they used to be. As the belts tighten, producers need to be great negotiators. You’ll need to prioritise multiple expectations whilst keeping the budget on track.</p>
<p>You need to be able to ballpark costs by just looking at a script. Knowing what’s possible for the money up front helps to manage expectations and lead the project in the right direction from the start. No one wants to be discussing overtime with the crew at 2am on an unscheduled night shoot.</p>
<h2>Stay relevant</h2>
<p>Even though you don’t need to know it all, it’s a good idea to keep up to date on latest creative technology. I’m a facilitator and it’s my job to know what’s available and then gather the experts that can deliver those technologies in order to achieve our creative goals. Don’t be a luddite.</p>
<h2>Respect everyone</h2>
<p>I started as runner and worked my way up. Whilst working in a Post House somewhere on Wardour St a client gave me a dressing down at 2am for bringing her a baked potato with butter ‘on’ the potato not on the side. I was a bit perturbed to say the least.</p>
<p>Consequently, I always treat everyone on set with respect. Please and thank you should never be under-estimated, whether it’s your Director going the extra mile for the client or a cup of tea and a biscuit delivered by the runner, being polite doesn’t cost a thing but makes everyone feel valued and usually results in a better end product.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">When tasked with creating a new digital tool for customers, it’s easy to get caught up in internal priorities.<br />
You might be focused on your own personal KPIs, what the Marketing team would like it to achieve or what your line manager demands in terms of growth and targets.</p>
<p>And while a collection of objectives seems like a sensible blueprint to start from, after processing the various departmental opinions and preferences, the project can quickly spiral out of control.</p>
<p>Maybe the boss has seen a pretty nifty site somewhere that has loads of animations and simply wants your build to echo that. Or marketing insist it should work in a different way, and give you a wildly different direction to follow before agreeing your original concept was better.</p>
<p>Maybe just hold on a minute, take a breath and ask yourself – what are you actually trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Is it brand awareness? Lead generation? Sales conversion?</p>
<p>And what are we using to measure success? Site visits? Dwell time? Conversions? Specific event interaction?</p>
<p>Or maybe it should be simple metrics around customer engagement. They’re the users remember.</p>
<p>Oh yes, them!</p>
<p>Because unless you’re carefully considering your user’s needs and looking at everything through that lens, you’re going to have a problem. They are the focus.</p>
<p>Who really wants to face the criticism of why people ‘simply aren’t engaging with the platform’, why they aren’t converting down the sales funnel or why they seem to close the application down as soon as they’ve opened it.</p>
<p>Your users have the ultimate power to disengage and find a better experience elsewhere immediately.</p>
<p>Like any high street, if you’ve an ugly and out of touch shop window you’re unlikely to get any footfall.</p>
<p>Even if you do get them through the door they are going to leave permanently if the experience is clunky, disorganised and unhelpful.</p>
<p>With this in mind, doesn’t it make sense to talk your customers before you design your shop?</p>
<p>Perhaps find out what they like and expect, what bothers them and what they are missing from other experiences.</p>
<p>You actually already know this, even if subconsciously. You’re a customer. We all are.</p>
<p>We’re the real experts in digital experience because we live it every day. We know what bugs us, frustrates us and what a smooth, hassle free experience looks and feels like.</p>
<p>You’re a human experiencing a digital world.</p>
<p>So don’t forget yourself, or others like you, when creating a new one.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2>Tips for creating a great digital human experience</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Do some user research</h3>
<p>Literally work with an agency or conduct the research yourself. Talk to a broad cross section of your target demographic, find out the problems they face, what’s frustrating, what they want to do, how long they need to do it, and where they do it from.</p>
<h3>Hire User Experience expertise – and listen to it!</h3>
<p>A good UX designer will already be very aware of the business objectives of a digital experience project and knows the best way to get users from A to B. They will have seen where and why applications fail many times before and know how to smooth the path and remove the obstacles. You’ve paid for their knowledge, so listen to it.</p>
<h3>A/B test</h3>
<p>Not sure which approach will work best? Really want to get this right? Be patient and let the data tell you. Produce multiple approaches and measure the results. Your users and the data will tell you what works best.</p>
<h3>Engaging User Interface design</h3>
<p>It’s not just the imagery or the buttons, it’s all the bits in between. It’s what happens when you hover over an image, how the page animates when you scroll down, the feel of a good online experience. The third dimension.</p>
<h3>Always evolve</h3>
<p>You followed points 1 to 4 religiously 18 months ago but it’s time to review. A year is a long time in digital, trends move on and so subconsciously do our tastes. That kitchen your friend put in four years ago, who uses ceramic hobs now? If you want to stay relevant, continue to invest.</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>I love my job and like to think I’m pretty experienced by now.</p>
<p>Aware, alert and able to divert from most potential red flags, but March 2020 like millions of others saw the Juice film team suddenly relocate to kitchen tables, dining rooms and kid’s bedrooms… all somewhere off the M4 corridor. Working from home, producing from Teams and slightly off course from the warm streets of Lyon which had been the location for our next Juice shoot.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of an era that probably most haven’t experienced in a lifetime and one I really didn’t see coming. A time when the film industry momentarily came to a grinding halt, took stock and drew breath before tearing up the production process as we had known it to move into a new age of filming safely in a pandemic.</p>
<p>As my first COVID era shoot loomed, I for one thought I had these new COVID procedures down pat. No problem I thought! It’s a producers’ job to iron out the creases and keep it all on track.</p>
<p>APA declaration form signed. PPE purchased, extra monitors on set, NHS check-in QR code laminated and approved COVID personnel on set. What could go wrong? Well, quite a bit as it happens…</p>
<p>It started at 6pm on the evening before the shoot with a phone call from the talent agency. “Sorry, your main actress won’t be turning up, she’s on another job today and her acting partner has tested positive for COVID&#8221;.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>&#8220;But don’t panic we’ve found someone else last minute that fits the casting brief”.</p>
<p>Phew! Disaster diverted.</p>
<p>New talent approved; call sheet adjusted; release form amended. It’s all systems&#8230;Umm no go apparently!</p>
<p>Our in-house cameraman calls, (who incidentally handled all of the kit loading into the van). “I&#8217;m so sorry but my flatmate has just tested positive for COVID and we’re all having to self- isolate”.</p>
<p>Wow, this is much trickier than I’d thought.</p>
<p>Frantic calls follow as I try to locate a new cameraman at short notice. By 9pm I had one on board and we were back on track.</p>
<p>Breathe…</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The night shoot is upon us and while myself and Alan have to disinfect and repack every piece of shoot kit our original cameraman handled &#8211; at least I&#8217;m on my way.</span></p>
<p>But not before another curveball.</p>
<p>The talent agency was fabulous at finding a new actress quickly, but not quite so great at informing me of her different dress size. A quick dash into a retail park on route to buy a whole new wardrobe and I’m on my way…again!</p>
<p>As I leave the drama behind me on the A40 I reach the set and wonder what this new world of social distancing, masks and constant sanitising has in store for me over the next two nights.</p>
<p>Turns out I needn’t have worried. As the Director shouts “Action” from a petrol station forecourt at 10pm, I’m conscious of one thing…</p>
<p>Whether it’s talent no shows, last-minute phone calls or wardrobe mishaps, we producers love a challenge…. at the end of the day, it’s just a night shoot.</p>
<p>No problem!</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner">Design trends are ever on the move, they have to be. In a world obsessed with visual representation, consumers are becoming more and more aware of how they’re being communicated to by brands.</p>
<p>Enter Gen Viz. This psychographic (need help with that word? It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychographic">here</a>) macro-trend describes young teens who rely on realism, authenticity and most importantly; championing a visual-first culture. Is it not surprising then, that this generation of kids has forged ahead, constructing unique identities for themselves inspired by visual styles from the past?</p>
<p>As designers, we are responding to this race for realness and the struggle for ultimate authenticity. We’re seeing a shift that is moving away from the “new, new” backwards towards design languages of the 70s, 80s and 90s. More specifically our 80s influence today is deeply rooted in the computer-generated graphics of the era: think early Nintendo gaming systems with bright, blocky shapes.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll look at the how and why of this hyper-visual design trend commonly described as: ‘Modern-Retro’.</p>
<p><strong>‘Walking in Memphis’.</strong></p>
<p>Form and structure are two styles closely linked with art in the 80s. Think furniture design, silhouettes in fashion and gaming but specifically, think the Memphis Design movement (handy additional pictures <a href="https://designmuseum.org/memphis">here</a>). Bright colours, cartoon-like shapes and fluid lines make up the fundamental building blocks of this artistic style, and it’s back with a vengeance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4683" style="width: 1630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4683" class="wp-image-4683 size-full" src="https://www.itsjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Bobby_Doherty_WillByrant_FB.jpg" alt="" width="1620" height="800" /><p id="caption-attachment-4683" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Bobby Doherty/New York Magazine. Facebook office, Texas, photo: Will Byrant.</p></div></p>
<p>In the images, the resemblance between 80s object design and a modern wall mural by artist Will Byrant is striking; from the use of colour, to the shapes adopted and the playful nature of the piece.</p>
<p><strong>Colour Pop.</strong></p>
<p>Bold colours belong on screens. Again think 80s computer games and Miami Vice. More and more design is taking influence from RGB colours and translating them into poppy process versions instead. In the examples below, an advertising campaign for online dating app OKcupid, Weiden + Kennedy New York adopted an 80s aesthetic to convey a very modern message in dating culture. The visuals nod nicely to Gen Viz; with messages grounded in authenticity and personality which is largely owed to the photographic style resembling works by Guy Bourdin, notably between 1967 and 1981 when he shot ad campaigns for shoe designer Charles Jourdan. Mysterious compositions, bright and blocky backgrounds make the output unquestionably retro and combined with central themes around online dating make for a very juxtaposing but pleasing combination.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4675" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4675" class="wp-image-4675 size-large" src="https://www.itsjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/OKcupid_Campaign-1024x662.png" alt="" width="1024" height="662" /><p id="caption-attachment-4675" class="wp-caption-text">Image from OKcupid campaign</p></div></p>
<p>Colour is so important in communication. Invariably your brand will use a pre-defined palette designed to best communicate your organisation’s proposition and value to its customers. But what if your message needs more vibrant hues like the example below? It’s got to be OK for a brand to ‘bend’ from time-to-time and show a sense of awareness. Think long term too; how will your brand palette stack up in five or ten years time when Gen Viz become your customers, employees or partners?</p>
<p><strong>Layer Up.</strong></p>
<p>The Modern-Retro movement employs the use of multi-faceted design, often layering shapes, images and colours together to create one visual composition. This style is popular in both print and digital applications creating impact and engagement. It also creates energy in a world of fast-paced online consumption where we want things immediately whether it be news, images, education or social updates. It’s not surprising that we’re serving content up in an energetic way to keep up with consumption rates. Layering isn’t new. But the way we’re layering imagery and styles today has become more obvious, less organic and more about making a statement. Think about how you could try combining brand imagery with supplementary ‘mood’ images, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4689" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4689" class="wp-image-4689 size-large" src="https://www.itsjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Grid-Images-1024x809.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="809" /><p id="caption-attachment-4689" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Top left and lower right: Serge Vasil for Adobe, top right: notebooks from Write &amp; Sketch, lower left: image from Mui Mui spring summer 2018 campaign.</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Science Fiction.</strong></p>
<p>Cue the phenomenon that is Stranger Things.  Its 80s styling is prevalent across its use of fashion, sets, neon typography and comic book style illustrations, not to mention the blatant nod to numerous Sci-Fi films from the 80s. Would the show have worked as well without all of its nostalgic references? (No, is the answer to that question in case you didn’t know). Why are so many young people engaging in a cultural era they have barely lived through, let alone remember? We’re not suggesting to remake E.T. here but the point is cultural reference. The Juice designers live for persona research, it helps us to focus a design style and to select the most appropriate application for any given message. So, before you start your next project, immerse yourself (and us) in your audience’s world and ask yourself, how can I make my work grab them? What points of cultural reference will make my message resonate more profoundly with my consumers?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_4690" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4690" class="wp-image-4690 size-large" src="https://www.itsjuice.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/StrangerThings_Netflix_Collage_01-1024x336.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="336" /><p id="caption-attachment-4690" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Netflix</p></div></p>
<p><strong>That’s a Wrap.</strong></p>
<p>From fashion to material design, to pop culture and television, the 80s is definitely enjoying a revival seeping through into every aspect of design. Is this coincidence or is it a backlash to common cultural and political influences; perhaps we’re just trying to lighten the mood? Or is it directly a result of Gen Viz, the group of young social activists striving for the ultimate in authenticity and living every day through a hypervisual lens? Maybe we won’t know. Maybe it’s enough just to appreciate this fun and engaging visual style, regardless of influence. You decide. And, if it’s right, be brave.</div>

					<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_18">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_19  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_18  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">What’s your real expectation of a visit to a car dealer (or retailer as the manufacturers generally call them these days)? Does it fill you with glee, with the sort of excitement that probably the second-biggest purchase in your life should create? Or… maybe, by any chance, you are predicting shiny suited sales guys you expect will know less than you do (other than their commission prospects)? How come we’ve ended up with this depressing prospect?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And yet. And yet. You probably should drive it before you buy it. It would be good to check out the colour in real life &#8211; especially if it&#8217;s orange. Ideally, getting to buy the right car with the right options would be a good way to spend the money. Shouldn’t it be exciting, informative, helpful, even fun? Is that too much to ask of a humungous purchase? And whilst the march of everything digital is a beautiful thing for people like us in the digital production business, there are still times when a ‘real’ experience is unbeatable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People need positive reasons to go to the bricks and mortar – and it can’t be just for signing the paperwork because, well, that’s not a reason anymore either. As consumers shift ever more online, there’s a huge opportunity for digital tools to have a positive, direct impact on retailing. You only need to read something like Accenture’s <a href="https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/insight-automotive-survey-what-digital-drivers-want"><span class="s2">Digital Driver Automotive Survey</span></a> (click for handy link) to see very clearly that digital is dominating the path to purchase and if you&#8217;re selling you need to be all over it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Where does digital fit in?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Information, information, information. The surge in digital innovation gives more power to savvy consumers and demands more transparency from retailers. If you can harness the power of digital you can create a pre-sale experience that resonates with customers </span><span class="s3"><i>and</i></span><span class="s1"> benefits sales teams &#8211; it all comes down to the right information at the right time in the purchase process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> As global screen usage <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Tablet-Users-Surpass-1-Billion-Worldwide-2015/1011806"><span class="s2">continues to grow</span></a>, product galleries, specs, running cost estimates and package options can all be reviewed, compared and admired from pretty much anywhere. Then there’s personalised film, up-to-date industry news, technology how-to&#8217;s, ‘Will it fit in my garage?’… the list goes on. Working with BMW Group in the UK our LaunchPad platform brings this all together, meaning that retailers can offer a reason, or quite a lot of reasons, to visit their showrooms more frequently for that touching and feeling thing. Whilst LaunchPad was born as an e-learning platform, with the commitment of the good people of BMW, we pushed “What say we.…?” over the edge of the cliff and here we are with a market-leading, smart, intuitive and versatile digital platform.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On the retailer side, the platform works with the existing infrastructure and data and is very ‘light’ from an IT perspective (phew). It delivers sales teams everything they need to know about the product from the day of launch, constantly refined and updated, daily industry news – no more scouring the web (we give ourselves Christmas Day off although people still log in, oh yes we know they do) &#8211; allowing information engagement to be tracked in real time, meaning the sales team have literally everything they need to talk confidently and knowledgeably about the brilliant product.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a prospect, LaunchPad gives you customised content and information based on your interactions with the BMW teams – either ‘live’ in the showroom or through personalised emails with open and click-through rates as a marketer you would genuinely not believe. This turns what was once a scattergun approach into something unique to you: a bespoke customer experience from pre-purchase to the first time you turn the key (which actually you don’t really do in a BMW anymore).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>What’s in it for me?</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The success of the system is down to the fact that its scope is basically limitless. It is completely bespoke, flexible and expandable, meaning it can be adapted to accommodate new trends, tech and customer feedback. </span><span class="s1">It doesn’t exist anywhere else on the market. It’s efficient, customisable, a high-end experience, which is right in line with BMW’s premium brand attributes.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Changing times.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As business adapts to new technology and trends, there’s a fantastic opportunity for brands and retailers to invest in digital products that improve customer experience and sales knowledge beyond all recognition. Digital absolutely does not mean the end of physical. If you have the bricks and mortar use it to drive the customers to you &#8211; and don&#8217;t disappoint them when they arrive (see paragraph 1&#8230;).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is just the beginning as the digital revolution merges learning and comms strategies. We’re working on something pretty neat right now that will transform the handover experience. No more reading the 350-page handbook and wondering which options you ordered all those months ago. ‘Subject to Specification’ becomes a thing of the past, and that means happier, more loyal punters who will talk positively about the experience down the pub (if it hasn’t shut).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="et_pb_section et_pb_section_9 et_section_regular" >
				
				
				
				
					<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_19">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_20  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_19  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most business leaders will say (publicly at least), that their employees are their most valuable assets. They’ll preach that good internal communications are vital for success. </span><span class="s1">Unless your workforce consists entirely of robots (in which case, congratulations, you can stop reading this now) you need more than warm words, you need a plan. </span><span class="s1">At Juice, we are comms content makers with opinions. As a business, we really try to get rid of the stigma that’s often associated with internal comms. Sounds simple enough…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dilemma that many organisations run into is that often the content, and the way that it gets communicated, comes across as dull, generic lip service rather than being genuinely engaging. Too few organisations have truly succeeded in connecting deeply with their people and hence miss out on the added commitment, motivation and productivity that inspired employees to deliver and radiate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That being said, developing a successful strategy is challenging. Employees are often sceptical of the formal ‘propaganda’ pumped in their direction. On top of this, as <a href="http://www.personneltoday.com/hr/one-seven-now-working-home/"><span class="s2">working practices change</span></a>, employees are more widely dispersed than ever before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good internal comms aren’t common, but with the right approach, it can be a piece of cake (something we are known for by the way).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Care for those inside as much as those outside</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All organisations surely view their customers as important because, well, they are. Our very simple opinion is that the people within an organisation deserve the same care and attention as the customers they serve.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marketers work tirelessly on research, campaign planning, channel selection and content that will win over the hearts and minds of their target audiences. Why not apply the same discipline, strategic thinking and some real imagination when communicating internally?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can involve all employees, wherever they’re based, with consistent, well thought out messaging while factoring in language and cultural differences. Easy enough to promise but check out <a href="http://www.withkiwi.com/"><span class="s2">KIWI</span></a>, our mobile-up communications platform, created specifically for organisations to communicate with a dispersed workforce.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or take <a href="https://www.itsjuice.com/portfolio/bmw-launchpad/"><span class="s2">BMW LaunchPad</span></a>, our platform for BMW’s retailer network, another smart and easily accessible way of delivering fast and varied information, helping better-informed employees deliver an improved sales experience to the customer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">See, you can make your cake and deliver it too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, apply these very clear rules to your employees. Invest time and real thought to your internal communications and you can achieve similarly deep connections, which will, in turn, increase loyalty (there are gerzillions of academic studies that prove it – as well as useful links like this <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11305139/Dogs-more-popular-than-cats-for-the-first-time-in-over-20-years.html"><span class="s2">one</span></a>).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>For the best results, mix internal and external content</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Organisations spend plenty of time and effort planning and developing content for specific audiences and channels. But people, whether employees, customers or that guy with the full head tattoo who runs along the A40 shouting at cars (yes, he is real), will only give their time to genuinely interesting (or funny) stuff.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So be smart: produce less content (more noise is so rarely better or more effective) and make sure it tells the best stories you have that are relevant and inspiring to everyone connected with your organisation. They are there, believe me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We were lucky enough to work with InterContinental Hotels &amp; Resorts to produce <a href="https://www.itsjuice.com/portfolio/legal-and-general/"><span class="s2">‘The Future of Local’</span></a>, a beautiful and multi-award-winning film, along with a dedicated website, sharing the film with both internal and external audiences.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The result? A truly inspired workforce and 2.3 million TED conversations worldwide.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With this thinking, we’ve also been able to help <a href="https://www.itsjuice.com/projects/"><span class="s2">BP</span></a> generate exceptional levels of engagement through animation with what might normally be considered dry content – like a Rich Tea. Yuk. Even when dunked.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And through our approach, teams at Legal &amp; General now have a new level of understanding and respect for the <a href="https://www.itsjuice.com/portfolio/legal-and-general/"><span class="s2">genuine issues</span></a> their customers are dealing with.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>We’re not talking megabucks</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Great comms aren’t dependent on money. They’re based on a real understanding of people and driven by ideas that change the way people think, feel and act.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, working on the basis that you probably know a lot about your own people already, go and champion an imaginative idea and really take care producing </span><span class="s3"><b>and</b></span><span class="s1"> delivering great content. You would be surprised by the number of people who do one or the other but not both…sigh…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>And with that – we’d like to ask you to be brave and think differently</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many internal comms campaigns are based on what senior management think people need, or simply on tweaking what’s been done before. You know these campaigns – universal waffly messaging that more often than not miss the target – and often has the opposite of the desired effect. Don’t do this, please. Resist the temptation to follow: be bold and creative.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As comms people that’s what we’re paid to do, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, we say seize this opportunity to attract and retain the best employees, inspiring higher levels of enthusiasm and productivity in the process. Encourage involvement, empower staff, act on their feedback and, when all’s said and done, take a look at your staff turnover and sick days – you’re going to like what you see. And ignore the doomsayers who claim staff shouldn’t eat cake. Just make sure it’s great cake, brilliantly delivered.</span></p>
