Bright colours, cartoon-like shapes and fluid lines make up the fundamental building blocks of this artistic style, and it\u2019s back with a vengeance.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4683\" style=\"width: 1630px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4683\" class=\"wp-image-4683 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Bobby_Doherty_WillByrant_FB.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1620\" height=\"800\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-4683\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Bobby Doherty\/New York Magazine.

Again think 80s computer games and Miami Vice. More and more design is taking influence from RGB colours and translating them into poppy process versions instead. In the examples below, an advertising campaign for online dating app OKcupid, Weiden + Kennedy New York adopted an 80s aesthetic to convey a very modern message in dating culture. The visuals nod nicely to Gen Viz; with messages grounded in authenticity and personality which is largely owed to the photographic style resembling works by Guy Bourdin, notably between 1967 and 1981 when he shot\u00a0ad campaigns for shoe designer Charles Jourdan. Mysterious compositions, bright and blocky backgrounds make the output unquestionably retro and combined with central themes around online dating make for a very juxtaposing but pleasing combination.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4675\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4675\" class=\"wp-image-4675 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/OKcupid_Campaign-1024x662.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"662\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-4675\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image from OKcupid campaign<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Colour is so important in communication. Invariably your brand will use a pre-defined palette designed to best communicate your organisation\u2019s proposition and value to its customers. But what if your message needs more vibrant hues like the example below? It\u2019s got to be OK for a brand to \u2018bend\u2019 from time-to-time and show a sense of awareness. Think long term too; how will your brand palette stack up in five or ten years time when Gen Viz become your customers, employees or partners?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Layer Up.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Modern-Retro movement employs the use of multi-faceted design, often layering shapes, images and colours together to create one visual composition. This style is popular in both print and digital applications creating impact and engagement. It also creates energy in a world of fast-paced online consumption where we want things immediately whether it be news, images, education or social updates. It\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re serving content up in an energetic way to keep up with consumption rates. Layering isn\u2019t new. But the way we\u2019re layering imagery and styles today has become more obvious, less organic and more about making a statement. Think about how you could try combining brand imagery with supplementary \u2018mood\u2019 images, for example.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4689\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4689\" class=\"wp-image-4689 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Grid-Images-1024x809.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"809\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-4689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credits: Top left and lower right: Serge Vasil for Adobe, top right: notebooks from Write &amp; Sketch, lower left: image from Mui Mui spring summer 2018 campaign.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Science Fiction.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cue the phenomenon that is Stranger Things.\u00a0 Its 80s styling is prevalent across its use of fashion, sets, neon typography and comic book style illustrations, not to mention the blatant nod to numerous Sci-Fi films from the 80s.
