It is viewed as one of the most fun, creative and artistic jobs you can actually make a decent living from. The realities are not always what you imagined but if it pays your rent, count yourself one of the lucky ones. Very few people I went to university with ended up using their degree.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to \u2018make it\u2019 in this business, be prepared to work harder than everyone else in the room, regardless of natural ability.<\/p>\n<p>It is highly likely that you will freelance for most of your career. Whilst this offers you an element of freedom it does unfortunately make you somewhat of a commodity. You are entirely replaceable without the luxury to coast through jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Since my early years of freelancing, I have been lucky enough earn full-time employment positions. However, I am now hard-wired to believe you are only as good as your last VT. Every piece of work you put out must be, at least in your mind, your best work yet.<\/p>\n<p>And this habit of working hard goes beyond your own role in a production. Put in some extra time to make the producer, director, and even the tea boy\u2019s life easier.<\/p>\n<p>Offer to help at the expense of your own downtime. Go out of your way to train people, discuss their work and offer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>It could be tomorrow or in ten years time, but that person you helped could recommend you for the biggest job of your life.<\/p>\n<h2>Be a technical expert<\/h2>\n<p>Be studious about the technicalities of your craft.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of researchers, producers and directors can edit but most of them don\u2019t have the time or interest to learn the latest technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing your software inside out helps you work more efficiently (something every client\/producer appreciates). With the technical part happening effortlessly, you release more time for the creative (fun) bit of editing.<\/p>\n<p>It pays to keep an eye on future software releases. New kit is released all the time and quickly adopted as industry standard. Knowing it better than anyone else, and what else is around the corner, increases your value.<\/p>\n<h2>Try on all hats of film making<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t just edit, make your own projects.<\/p>\n<p>Shoot, direct, produce, write.<\/p>\n<p>If you play an instrument, learn about audio engineering. Compose. Mix. It all helps.<\/p>\n<p>Look to gain perspective on other people\u2019s job roles and how a project comes together. This gives you empathy with your team, which is hugely important in problem solving and selling the final product.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout my career I have dipped my toe in every pond. I have learned how to light shoots, operate camera, colour grade, create motion graphics\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Try to wear as many hats as possible, at least at the start of your professional journey. Whilst you may want to progress as an editor, having a good foundational knowledge of all filmmaking departments will benefit you. Everything I have learned in film making informs my editing decisions.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/shooting-food.jpg&#8221; alt=&#8221;Food Shoot&#8221; title_text=&#8221;Food Shoot&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Text&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; text_font=&#8221;Yantramanav|300|||||||&#8221; text_line_height=&#8221;1.8em&#8221; header_2_font_size=&#8221;29px&#8221; header_2_line_height=&#8221;1.5em&#8221; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2>Be selective (eventually)<\/h2>\n<p>Even though the goal is to move from \u2018video generalist\u2019 to editor, you will eventually need to specialise even further.<\/p>\n<p>Starting out, try your hand at many different styles of film. Cut short films, long films, 30 second clips, 1 minute clips etc.<\/p>\n<p>But when you learn what you enjoy most, make that your niche and have your showreel reflect it.<\/p>\n<p>If you currently make lots of corporate videos, but you want to edit feature films, only show off work that is relevant. This may mean going out and shooting your own feature pieces first.<\/p>\n<p>It can be tempting to show off your \u2018range\u2019 but big producers don\u2019t like to take chances on generalists &#8211; they like safe bets. And who can blame them when it\u2019s their reputation on the line!<\/p>\n<p>I have heard of Directors of Photography who shoot food being turned down for ice cream ads because they haven\u2019t shot the relevant flavour before. \u201cSo, you have strawberry on your reel but no chocolate?\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Be sociable<\/h2>\n<p>Talent aside, most work recommendations throughout your career will come from being a nice, amenable person to work with.<\/p>\n<p>The industry is small and people will remember you &#8211; especially if you act like a dick. Treat others how you like to be treated. It sounds obvious but so many people forget it.<\/p>\n<p>In general, editors are \u2018below the line\u2019 and not important enough to be able to get away with being a \u2018screamer\u2019 or \u2018difficult to work with\u2019. Be respectful to even the lowest person in a production, you never know someone\u2019s career trajectory &#8211; they may become your producer one day!<\/p>\n<p>It is also worth remembering that editing is one of the more time-intensive jobs in video production. People have to sit in a room with you for long periods of time. I know many employers who will hire someone they get on with over a more experienced person they can\u2019t stand to be around.<\/p>\n<h2>Develop a thick skin<\/h2>\n<p>You can\u2019t afford to be too sensitive in this business.<\/p>\n<p>It is a stressful industry where a lot of important players are time poor. They don\u2019t always have the bandwidth to consider other people\u2019s feelings.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t take rants and raves too personally. You will inevitably face criticism of your art, and thus your worth, at some point. Some of it will be valid, some perhaps not, but you should take feedback on the chin and remember who the boss is. Every producer or client has personal preferences.<\/p>\n<p>At first, new clients or less experienced executives might not know what they want from a video edit. Take time to build a rapport with them. Get to know their quirks. Developing an understanding early on can save a lot of time and heartache in the long run.<span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;3_5,2_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;3_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Text&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; text_font=&#8221;Yantramanav|300|||||||&#8221; text_line_height=&#8221;1.8em&#8221; header_2_font_size=&#8221;29px&#8221; header_2_line_height=&#8221;1.5em&#8221; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h2>Adapt, collaborate and listen<\/h2>\n<p>Ultimately, your job is to deliver for the client.<\/p>\n<p>At any time be prepared for them to change the brief, the duration, the concept, pause or even scrap the project entirely.

Film making is a collaborative process of different perspectives. In my experience, the best producers and directors will listen to all view points and then use the best idea in the room.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;2_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/video-editor-dan-jewell.jpg&#8221; alt=&#8221;Dan Jewell&#8221; title_text=&#8221;Dan Jewell&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;][\/et_pb_image][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Text&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; text_font=&#8221;Yantramanav|300|||||||&#8221; text_line_height=&#8221;1.8em&#8221; header_2_font_size=&#8221;29px&#8221; header_2_line_height=&#8221;1.5em&#8221; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>Your paymasters will push you (sometimes to near breaking point) to get the best out of the material.

In a world obsessed with visual representation, consumers are becoming more and more aware of how they\u2019re being communicated to by brands.\r\n\r\nEnter Gen Viz. This psychographic (need help with that word? It\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Psychographic\">here<\/a>) macro-trend describes young teens who rely on realism, authenticity and most importantly; championing a visual-first culture. Is it not surprising then, that this generation of kids has forged ahead, constructing unique identities for themselves inspired by visual styles from the past?\r\n\r\nAs designers, we are responding to this race for realness and the struggle for ultimate authenticity. We\u2019re seeing a shift that is moving away from the \u201cnew, new\u201d backwards towards design languages of the 70s, 80s and 90s. More specifically our 80s influence today is deeply rooted in the computer-generated graphics of the era: think early Nintendo gaming systems with bright, blocky shapes.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at the how and why of this hyper-visual design trend commonly described as: \u2018Modern-Retro\u2019.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2018Walking in Memphis\u2019.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nForm and structure are two styles closely linked with art in the 80s. Think furniture design, silhouettes in fashion and gaming but specifically, think the Memphis Design movement (handy additional pictures\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/designmuseum.org\/memphis\">here<\/a>). Bright colours, cartoon-like shapes and fluid lines make up the fundamental building blocks of this artistic style, and it\u2019s back with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4683\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1620\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4683 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Bobby_Doherty_WillByrant_FB.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1620\" height=\"800\" \/> Image credit: Bobby Doherty\/New York Magazine. Facebook office, Texas, photo: Will Byrant.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the images, the resemblance between 80s object design and a modern wall mural by artist Will Byrant is striking; from the use of colour, to the shapes adopted and the playful nature of the piece.\r\n\r\n<strong>Colour Pop.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBold colours belong on screens. Again think 80s computer games and Miami Vice. More and more design is taking influence from RGB colours and translating them into poppy process versions instead. In the examples below, an advertising campaign for online dating app OKcupid, Weiden + Kennedy New York adopted an 80s aesthetic to convey a very modern message in dating culture. The visuals nod nicely to Gen Viz; with messages grounded in authenticity and personality which is largely owed to the photographic style resembling works by Guy Bourdin, notably between 1967 and 1981 when he shot\u00a0ad campaigns for shoe designer Charles Jourdan. Mysterious compositions, bright and blocky backgrounds make the output unquestionably retro and combined with central themes around online dating make for a very juxtaposing but pleasing combination.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4675\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4675 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/OKcupid_Campaign-1024x662.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"662\" \/> Image from OKcupid campaign[\/caption]\r\n\r\nColour is so important in communication. Invariably your brand will use a pre-defined palette designed to best communicate your organisation\u2019s proposition and value to its customers. But what if your message needs more vibrant hues like the example below? It\u2019s got to be OK for a brand to \u2018bend\u2019 from time-to-time and show a sense of awareness. Think long term too; how will your brand palette stack up in five or ten years time when Gen Viz become your customers, employees or partners?\r\n\r\n<strong>Layer Up.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Modern-Retro movement employs the use of multi-faceted design, often layering shapes, images and colours together to create one visual composition. This style is popular in both print and digital applications creating impact and engagement. It also creates energy in a world of fast-paced online consumption where we want things immediately whether it be news, images, education or social updates. It\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re serving content up in an energetic way to keep up with consumption rates. Layering isn\u2019t new. But the way we\u2019re layering imagery and styles today has become more obvious, less organic and more about making a statement. Think about how you could try combining brand imagery with supplementary \u2018mood\u2019 images, for example.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4689\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4689 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Grid-Images-1024x809.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"809\" \/> Image credits: Top left and lower right: Serge Vasil for Adobe, top right: notebooks from Write & Sketch, lower left: image from Mui Mui spring summer 2018 campaign.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Science Fiction.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCue the phenomenon that is Stranger Things.\u00a0 Its 80s styling is prevalent across its use of fashion, sets, neon typography and comic book style illustrations, not to mention the blatant nod to numerous Sci-Fi films from the 80s. Would the show have worked as well without all of its nostalgic references? (No, is the answer to that question in case you didn\u2019t know). Why are so many young people engaging in a cultural era they have barely lived through, let alone remember? We\u2019re not suggesting to remake E.T. here but the point is cultural reference. The Juice designers live for persona research, it helps us to focus a design style and to select the most appropriate application for any given message. So, before you start your next project, immerse yourself (and us) in your audience\u2019s world and ask yourself, how can I make my work grab them? What points of cultural reference will make my message resonate more profoundly with my consumers?\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4690\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4690 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/StrangerThings_Netflix_Collage_01-1024x336.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"336\" \/> Image credit: Netflix[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>That\u2019s a Wrap.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFrom fashion to material design, to pop culture and television, the 80s is definitely enjoying a revival seeping through into every aspect of design. Is this coincidence or is it a backlash to common cultural and political influences; perhaps we\u2019re just trying to lighten the mood? Or is it directly a result of Gen Viz, the group of young social activists striving for the ultimate in authenticity and living every day through a hypervisual lens? Maybe we won\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s enough just to appreciate this fun and engaging visual style, regardless of influence. You decide. And, if it\u2019s right, be brave.","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[25,15,24],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.5 -
