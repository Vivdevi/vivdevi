Shouldn\u2019t it be exciting, informative, helpful, even fun? Is that too much to ask of a humungous purchase? And whilst the march of everything digital is a beautiful thing for people like us in the digital production business, there are still times when a \u2018real\u2019 experience is unbeatable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">People need positive reasons to go to the bricks and mortar \u2013 and it can\u2019t be just for signing the paperwork because, well, that\u2019s not a reason anymore either. As consumers shift ever more online, there\u2019s a huge opportunity for digital tools to have a positive, direct impact on retailing.

Then there\u2019s personalised film, up-to-date industry news, technology how-to&#8217;s, \u2018Will it fit in my garage?\u2019\u2026 the list goes on. Working with BMW Group in the UK our LaunchPad platform brings this all together, meaning that retailers can offer a reason, or quite a lot of reasons, to visit their showrooms more frequently for that touching and feeling thing. Whilst LaunchPad was born as an e-learning platform, with the commitment of the good people of BMW, we pushed \u201cWhat say we.\u2026?\u201d over the edge of the cliff and here we are with a market-leading, smart, intuitive and versatile digital platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">On the retailer side, the platform works with the existing infrastructure and data and is very \u2018light\u2019 from an IT perspective (phew). It delivers sales teams everything they need to know about the product from the day of launch, constantly refined and updated, daily industry news \u2013 no more scouring the web (we give ourselves Christmas Day off although people still log in, oh yes we know they do) &#8211; allowing information engagement to be tracked in real time, meaning the sales team have literally everything they need to talk confidently and knowledgeably about the brilliant product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">As a prospect, LaunchPad gives you customised content and information based on your interactions with the BMW teams \u2013 either \u2018live\u2019 in the showroom or through personalised emails with open and click-through rates as a marketer you would genuinely not believe. This turns what was once a scattergun approach into something unique to you: a bespoke customer experience from pre-purchase to the first time you turn the key (which actually you don\u2019t really do in a BMW anymore).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What\u2019s in it for me?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The success of the system is down to the fact that its scope is basically limitless.

Digital absolutely does not mean the end of physical.
