Juice\u2019s Becca Dymock shares her thoughts, experience and top tips\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Be prepared<\/h2>\n<p>For me, preparation is key. You have to be organised. Make sure all aspects of the shoot are agreed and signed off by the client before you arrive on location.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that changes to wardrobe, props and scripts will delay shooting. This inevitably costs time and money (and tends to annoy the Director). While spur of the moment changes will always be likely, it is best to try and keep them minimal \u2013 or at least have ready-made back up plans for potential, foreseeable problems.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn from others<\/h2>\n<p>So much of what makes a good producer is about learning from those who know more than you. I had a couple of fantastic mentors when I started out who gave me just the right amount of responsibility. They gave me space to grow and learn from the odd mistake \u2013 whilst stopping me from making costly ones!<\/p>\n<p>I do remember some other \u2018questionable\u2019 mentoring however. In one particular temp job I had as a fledgling production assistant, I asked the producer if she could help me when applying for child licenses. With her feet up on a table reading a book she replied, \u201cDarling I wouldn\u2019t have a clue, I haven\u2019t been a PA for 12 years\u201d. I\u2019m not sure she even looked up.<\/p>\n<h2>Know your team<\/h2>\n<p>Gathering the right people and setting the tone of the production is paramount. Knowing upfront which Directors\/Editors are right for the creative treatment is absolutely essential. We\u2019re all there for a common cause, to get the best output for the client, and we can only do that if everyone is on the same page.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing the people you work with and understanding their craft is key to having a smooth shoot. At the start of a project, you need to ask yourself what skillset does your team need in order to bring the creative vision to life.<\/p>\n<h2>Communication<\/h2>\n<p>You really need to be a good communicator. With a looming air date or deadline, you need to move fast to get all those necessary approvals and that requires respectful but determined communication. Setting out and sharing your key milestones in advance will help everyone know what is expected of them, and when by. This helps keep the project on time and in budget.<\/p>\n<h2>Negotiation<\/h2>\n<p>No getting around it, budgets aren\u2019t what they used to be. As the belts tighten, producers need to be great negotiators. You\u2019ll need to prioritise multiple expectations whilst keeping the budget on track.<\/p>\n<p>You need to be able to ballpark costs by just looking at a script. Knowing what\u2019s possible for the money up front helps to manage expectations and lead the project in the right direction from the start. No one wants to be discussing overtime with the crew at 2am on an unscheduled night shoot.<\/p>\n<h2>Stay relevant<\/h2>\n<p>Even though you don\u2019t need to know it all, it\u2019s a good idea to keep up to date on latest creative technology. I\u2019m a facilitator and it\u2019s my job to know what\u2019s available and then gather the experts that can deliver those technologies in order to achieve our creative goals. Don\u2019t be a luddite.<\/p>\n<h2>Respect everyone<\/h2>\n<p>I started as runner and worked my way up. Whilst working in a Post House somewhere on Wardour St a client gave me a dressing down at 2am for bringing her a baked potato with butter \u2018on\u2019 the potato not on the side. I was a bit perturbed to say the least.<\/p>\n<p>Consequently, I always treat everyone on set with respect. Please and thank you should never be under-estimated, whether it\u2019s your Director going the extra mile for the client or a cup of tea and a biscuit delivered by the runner, being polite doesn\u2019t cost a thing but makes everyone feel valued and usually results in a better end product.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fancy getting started in this industry?<\/p>\n<p>Browse the Juice jobs page for our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/working-with-us\/\">latest vacancies<\/a>, or get in touch today.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;section&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.22&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;29px|||||&#8221;][et_pb_row admin_label=&#8221;row&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;19px|||||&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Text&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; text_font=&#8221;Yantramanav|300|||||||&#8221; text_line_height=&#8221;1.8em&#8221; header_2_font_size=&#8221;29px&#8221; header_2_line_height=&#8221;1.5em&#8221; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221;] What skills and qualities are needed to be a good video producer?

In a world obsessed with visual representation, consumers are becoming more and more aware of how they\u2019re being communicated to by brands.\r\n\r\nEnter Gen Viz. This psychographic (need help with that word? It\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Psychographic\">here<\/a>) macro-trend describes young teens who rely on realism, authenticity and most importantly; championing a visual-first culture. Is it not surprising then, that this generation of kids has forged ahead, constructing unique identities for themselves inspired by visual styles from the past?\r\n\r\nAs designers, we are responding to this race for realness and the struggle for ultimate authenticity. We\u2019re seeing a shift that is moving away from the \u201cnew, new\u201d backwards towards design languages of the 70s, 80s and 90s. More specifically our 80s influence today is deeply rooted in the computer-generated graphics of the era: think early Nintendo gaming systems with bright, blocky shapes.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at the how and why of this hyper-visual design trend commonly described as: \u2018Modern-Retro\u2019.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2018Walking in Memphis\u2019.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nForm and structure are two styles closely linked with art in the 80s. Think furniture design, silhouettes in fashion and gaming but specifically, think the Memphis Design movement (handy additional pictures\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/designmuseum.org\/memphis\">here<\/a>). Bright colours, cartoon-like shapes and fluid lines make up the fundamental building blocks of this artistic style, and it\u2019s back with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4683\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1620\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4683 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Bobby_Doherty_WillByrant_FB.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1620\" height=\"800\" \/> Image credit: Bobby Doherty\/New York Magazine. Facebook office, Texas, photo: Will Byrant.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the images, the resemblance between 80s object design and a modern wall mural by artist Will Byrant is striking; from the use of colour, to the shapes adopted and the playful nature of the piece.\r\n\r\n<strong>Colour Pop.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBold colours belong on screens. Again think 80s computer games and Miami Vice. More and more design is taking influence from RGB colours and translating them into poppy process versions instead. In the examples below, an advertising campaign for online dating app OKcupid, Weiden + Kennedy New York adopted an 80s aesthetic to convey a very modern message in dating culture. The visuals nod nicely to Gen Viz; with messages grounded in authenticity and personality which is largely owed to the photographic style resembling works by Guy Bourdin, notably between 1967 and 1981 when he shot\u00a0ad campaigns for shoe designer Charles Jourdan. Mysterious compositions, bright and blocky backgrounds make the output unquestionably retro and combined with central themes around online dating make for a very juxtaposing but pleasing combination.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4675\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4675 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/OKcupid_Campaign-1024x662.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"662\" \/> Image from OKcupid campaign[\/caption]\r\n\r\nColour is so important in communication. Invariably your brand will use a pre-defined palette designed to best communicate your organisation\u2019s proposition and value to its customers. But what if your message needs more vibrant hues like the example below? It\u2019s got to be OK for a brand to \u2018bend\u2019 from time-to-time and show a sense of awareness. Think long term too; how will your brand palette stack up in five or ten years time when Gen Viz become your customers, employees or partners?\r\n\r\n<strong>Layer Up.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Modern-Retro movement employs the use of multi-faceted design, often layering shapes, images and colours together to create one visual composition. This style is popular in both print and digital applications creating impact and engagement. It also creates energy in a world of fast-paced online consumption where we want things immediately whether it be news, images, education or social updates. It\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re serving content up in an energetic way to keep up with consumption rates. Layering isn\u2019t new. But the way we\u2019re layering imagery and styles today has become more obvious, less organic and more about making a statement. Think about how you could try combining brand imagery with supplementary \u2018mood\u2019 images, for example.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4689\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4689 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Grid-Images-1024x809.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"809\" \/> Image credits: Top left and lower right: Serge Vasil for Adobe, top right: notebooks from Write & Sketch, lower left: image from Mui Mui spring summer 2018 campaign.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Science Fiction.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCue the phenomenon that is Stranger Things.\u00a0 Its 80s styling is prevalent across its use of fashion, sets, neon typography and comic book style illustrations, not to mention the blatant nod to numerous Sci-Fi films from the 80s. Would the show have worked as well without all of its nostalgic references? (No, is the answer to that question in case you didn\u2019t know). Why are so many young people engaging in a cultural era they have barely lived through, let alone remember? We\u2019re not suggesting to remake E.T. here but the point is cultural reference. The Juice designers live for persona research, it helps us to focus a design style and to select the most appropriate application for any given message. So, before you start your next project, immerse yourself (and us) in your audience\u2019s world and ask yourself, how can I make my work grab them? What points of cultural reference will make my message resonate more profoundly with my consumers?\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4690\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4690 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/StrangerThings_Netflix_Collage_01-1024x336.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"336\" \/> Image credit: Netflix[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>That\u2019s a Wrap.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFrom fashion to material design, to pop culture and television, the 80s is definitely enjoying a revival seeping through into every aspect of design. Is this coincidence or is it a backlash to common cultural and political influences; perhaps we\u2019re just trying to lighten the mood? Or is it directly a result of Gen Viz, the group of young social activists striving for the ultimate in authenticity and living every day through a hypervisual lens? Maybe we won\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s enough just to appreciate this fun and engaging visual style, regardless of influence. You decide. And, if it\u2019s right, be brave.","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[15,22,24],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.5 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Top Tips To Make It As A Video Producer | Juice Moving Images<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Juice&#039;s Becca Dymock shares her opinion about what is needed to make it as a top video producer -
