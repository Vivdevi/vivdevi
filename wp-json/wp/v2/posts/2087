Our very simple opinion is that the people within an organisation deserve the same care and attention as the customers they serve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Marketers work tirelessly on research, campaign planning, channel selection and content that will win over the hearts and minds of their target audiences. Why not apply the same discipline, strategic thinking and some real imagination when communicating internally?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can involve all employees, wherever they\u2019re based, with consistent, well thought out messaging while factoring in language and cultural differences. Easy enough to promise but check out\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.withkiwi.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\">KIWI<\/span><\/a>, our mobile-up communications platform, created specifically for organisations to communicate with a dispersed workforce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Or take\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/portfolio\/bmw-launchpad\/\"><span class=\"s2\">BMW LaunchPad<\/span><\/a>, our platform for BMW\u2019s retailer network, another smart and easily accessible way of delivering fast and varied information, helping better-informed employees deliver an improved sales experience to the customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">See, you can make your cake and deliver it too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, apply these very clear rules to your employees. Invest time and real thought to your internal communications and you can achieve similarly deep connections, which will, in turn, increase loyalty (there are gerzillions of academic studies that prove it \u2013 as well as useful links like this\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/uknews\/law-and-order\/11305139\/Dogs-more-popular-than-cats-for-the-first-time-in-over-20-years.html\"><span class=\"s2\">one<\/span><\/a>).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>For the best results, mix internal and external content<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Organisations spend plenty of time and effort planning and developing content for specific audiences and channels.
