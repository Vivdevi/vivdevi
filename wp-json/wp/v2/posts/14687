Tell everyone how it began, how you\u2019ve made it, what you\u2019ve learnt etc. But don\u2019t waffle on like you normally would. Oh, and get it done by mid-August so we can publish it in time for the anniversary in early September.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>September 30th.<\/p>\n<h2>In the beginning\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>Juice was a mistake.<\/p>\n<p>OK, maybe not the greatest opening line of a short piece to celebrate 20 glorious years (well, about 18 glorious ones and a couple of slightly crap ones).<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps \u2018Juice wasn\u2019t the plan\u2019 is a better opener.<\/p>\n<p>It only really exists as a result of my inability to find a decent, honourable and interesting employer to work for. At the time, all those years back, I wasn\u2019t especially bothered by the \u2018creative\u2019 industry. I was testing a few other career avenues first \u2013 trucks, ice cream, even Teletubbies bubble bath (a tragic low point for sure).<\/p>\n<p>I worked for a couple of good people and companies but didn\u2019t feel especially fulfilled. Looking back, it wasn\u2019t until I founded Juice that I felt like I had finally found my \u2018home\u2019 &#8211; surrounded by people much cleverer and more creative than me. But like all good things, finding it required a bit of a hop, or maybe a gigantic leap would be better terminology. Especially after I walked out of my last \u2018employed\u2019 job with nowhere to go and three months from being a dad for the first time.<\/p>\n<h2>Early days\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>I sold my car, a silver Fiesta I really liked, sad \u2013 went to the local car auction, bought something cheap and unwieldy for a third of the cash and spent the rest on a Macbook (special mention to Apple \u2013 for you have been comprehensively rinsing us for all those beautiful devices for 20 years). I also bought one of those all-in-one, printer\/scanner\/copier\/fax things that lasted about a year before one of the key functions \u2013 probably the printer \u2013 ceased to work. And then Juice \u2026 was a thing &#8211; in my spare bedroom with a crying baby next door. The original \u2018work from home\u2019. Literally.<\/p>\n<p>We were a video production business (at least that\u2019s what we told people). And for that I must largely credit my first partner in crime, Deane Thrussell. Deane was one of those guys (and still is) who could make a fully functioning edit suite out of a takeaway coffee cup, a ball of string and a small rodent. He would create magic whilst I duplicated DVDs all weekend on the kitchen table. Our one-MacBook-and-a-fax-machine business punched way above our weight but we worked, and worked, and worked, and drank a lot of increasingly excellent coffee to deliver for our first small collection of clients (Castrol BP was the very first and is still one today). In 20 years that attitude remains embedded in the DNA of this company. And we\u2019re certainly known for our coffee.<\/p>\n<h2>This seems to be working\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>The digital \u2018arm\u2019 of the business followed a few years later (again, formed by another bunch of people much cleverer than me). Our first \u2018big fish\u2019 being Williams Formula One and Accenture. I pulled together a team of enthusiastic and very talented freelancers. They seemed to like working with us, they stayed, and so built our fledgling digital business from nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we have had many moments of stress, strain and humour over the years \u2013 like early on when the VP of a major client awarded us a project that ran into many \u00a3\u2019000\u2019s \u2013 a big deal for us at the time. He came down to the farm to check on progress and upon walking in, seeing all 5 of us, famously said \u2018where the hell are the rest of you?\u2019. 16 years later that client is still with us.<\/p>\n<p>Or when we were developing our new offices. The bank manager came round, saw the scale of what we were building and said with a smile, \u2018you\u2019ll go bust\u2019. We changed banks.<\/p>\n<p>I always believed that we could go toe-to-toe with London. I refused to accept that creative excellence only existed within the five streets of W1. I find it especially ironic now that the message seems to be that \u2018great work can be done anywhere\u2019. Well, we were 20 years ahead of you all on that one!<\/p>\n<p>Overall, we\u2019ve done more things right than wrong, but we\u2019ve never been good at shouting about it &#8211; we\u2019re too busy \u2013 those awards forms are so tedious. Perhaps now that we\u2019re 20, we might start entering some\u2026I\u2019m told \u2018it\u2019s a good thing\u2019.<\/p>\n<h2>Great clients make great work easy\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve worked with some incredible clients and people over the years. It\u2019s said that you can\u2019t claim to be true \u2018partners\u2019 unless you have a financial tie-in. That\u2019s junk. It demands a mindset, and real actions on both \u2018sides\u2019 \u2013 get that right and we can all pull in the same, results led direction.<\/p>\n<p>For me, it\u2019s not that complicated. We stick to our principles. We won\u2019t just work with anyone. Clients need to share our basic, collaborative beliefs. If you think we are &#8216;just a supplier&#8217; \u2013 you\u2019ll be disappointed. Our people, and their talents, deserve better than that.<\/p>\n<p>I always felt that if we work hard at the basic stuff &#8211; paying people on time, being straightforward to deal with, being loyal, sharing success \u2013 we would be just fine. If you can do no more, sleepless nights won\u2019t follow.<\/p>\n<p>We work hard to treat our contractors, suppliers and freelancers &#8211; many of whom have been making us look brilliant for years &#8211; as if they are full-time Juicers. We\u2019re always grateful, knowing you could do the same amazing things elsewhere, but you still often chose to do it with us over them. Thank you.<\/p>\n<h2>Our people<\/h2>\n<p>And to the Juice team members &#8211; who have, of course, changed over the years (although several are headed for the long service award \u2013 a Covid booster). You are, by a million miles, the single most important reason for our success and reputation.<\/p>\n<p>We work hard every day to try to do right by you, inspire you and find you great projects to work on that you can be rightly proud of.<\/p>\n<p>You. Are. Amazing.<\/p>\n<p>As my elderly mum said when she came to Juice Towers (which is a pretty nice place if you\u2019ve never been), \u2018when are you going to get a proper job?\u2019. These words are immortalised on one of the walls of our office. If your mum can\u2019t keep you humble and grounded, then who can?<\/p>\n<p>One day I might take her advice \u2013 that supermarket van delivery driving job awaits &#8211; but we have lots to do before then.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/juice-hq.jpg&#8221; alt=&#8221;The Juice Team&#8221; title_text=&#8221;The Juice Team&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][\/et_pb_image][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;section&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.22&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;29px|||||&#8221;][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.5.3&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_font=&#8221;Yantramanav|300|||||||&#8221;] At some point earlier this month we celebrated our 20th birthday.

In a world obsessed with visual representation, consumers are becoming more and more aware of how they\u2019re being communicated to by brands.\r\n\r\nEnter Gen Viz. This psychographic (need help with that word? It\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Psychographic\">here<\/a>) macro-trend describes young teens who rely on realism, authenticity and most importantly; championing a visual-first culture. Is it not surprising then, that this generation of kids has forged ahead, constructing unique identities for themselves inspired by visual styles from the past?\r\n\r\nAs designers, we are responding to this race for realness and the struggle for ultimate authenticity. We\u2019re seeing a shift that is moving away from the \u201cnew, new\u201d backwards towards design languages of the 70s, 80s and 90s. More specifically our 80s influence today is deeply rooted in the computer-generated graphics of the era: think early Nintendo gaming systems with bright, blocky shapes.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at the how and why of this hyper-visual design trend commonly described as: \u2018Modern-Retro\u2019.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2018Walking in Memphis\u2019.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nForm and structure are two styles closely linked with art in the 80s. Think furniture design, silhouettes in fashion and gaming but specifically, think the Memphis Design movement (handy additional pictures\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/designmuseum.org\/memphis\">here<\/a>). Bright colours, cartoon-like shapes and fluid lines make up the fundamental building blocks of this artistic style, and it\u2019s back with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4683\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1620\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4683 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Bobby_Doherty_WillByrant_FB.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1620\" height=\"800\" \/> Image credit: Bobby Doherty\/New York Magazine. Facebook office, Texas, photo: Will Byrant.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the images, the resemblance between 80s object design and a modern wall mural by artist Will Byrant is striking; from the use of colour, to the shapes adopted and the playful nature of the piece.\r\n\r\n<strong>Colour Pop.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBold colours belong on screens. Again think 80s computer games and Miami Vice. More and more design is taking influence from RGB colours and translating them into poppy process versions instead. In the examples below, an advertising campaign for online dating app OKcupid, Weiden + Kennedy New York adopted an 80s aesthetic to convey a very modern message in dating culture. The visuals nod nicely to Gen Viz; with messages grounded in authenticity and personality which is largely owed to the photographic style resembling works by Guy Bourdin, notably between 1967 and 1981 when he shot\u00a0ad campaigns for shoe designer Charles Jourdan. Mysterious compositions, bright and blocky backgrounds make the output unquestionably retro and combined with central themes around online dating make for a very juxtaposing but pleasing combination.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4675\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4675 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/OKcupid_Campaign-1024x662.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"662\" \/> Image from OKcupid campaign[\/caption]\r\n\r\nColour is so important in communication. Invariably your brand will use a pre-defined palette designed to best communicate your organisation\u2019s proposition and value to its customers. But what if your message needs more vibrant hues like the example below? It\u2019s got to be OK for a brand to \u2018bend\u2019 from time-to-time and show a sense of awareness. Think long term too; how will your brand palette stack up in five or ten years time when Gen Viz become your customers, employees or partners?\r\n\r\n<strong>Layer Up.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Modern-Retro movement employs the use of multi-faceted design, often layering shapes, images and colours together to create one visual composition. This style is popular in both print and digital applications creating impact and engagement. It also creates energy in a world of fast-paced online consumption where we want things immediately whether it be news, images, education or social updates. It\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re serving content up in an energetic way to keep up with consumption rates. Layering isn\u2019t new. But the way we\u2019re layering imagery and styles today has become more obvious, less organic and more about making a statement. Think about how you could try combining brand imagery with supplementary \u2018mood\u2019 images, for example.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4689\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4689 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Grid-Images-1024x809.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"809\" \/> Image credits: Top left and lower right: Serge Vasil for Adobe, top right: notebooks from Write & Sketch, lower left: image from Mui Mui spring summer 2018 campaign.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Science Fiction.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCue the phenomenon that is Stranger Things.\u00a0 Its 80s styling is prevalent across its use of fashion, sets, neon typography and comic book style illustrations, not to mention the blatant nod to numerous Sci-Fi films from the 80s. Would the show have worked as well without all of its nostalgic references? (No, is the answer to that question in case you didn\u2019t know). Why are so many young people engaging in a cultural era they have barely lived through, let alone remember? We\u2019re not suggesting to remake E.T. here but the point is cultural reference. The Juice designers live for persona research, it helps us to focus a design style and to select the most appropriate application for any given message. So, before you start your next project, immerse yourself (and us) in your audience\u2019s world and ask yourself, how can I make my work grab them? What points of cultural reference will make my message resonate more profoundly with my consumers?\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4690\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4690 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/StrangerThings_Netflix_Collage_01-1024x336.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"336\" \/> Image credit: Netflix[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>That\u2019s a Wrap.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFrom fashion to material design, to pop culture and television, the 80s is definitely enjoying a revival seeping through into every aspect of design. Is this coincidence or is it a backlash to common cultural and political influences; perhaps we\u2019re just trying to lighten the mood? Or is it directly a result of Gen Viz, the group of young social activists striving for the ultimate in authenticity and living every day through a hypervisual lens? Maybe we won\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s enough just to appreciate this fun and engaging visual style, regardless of influence. You decide. And, if it\u2019s right, be brave.","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[26,15],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.5 -
