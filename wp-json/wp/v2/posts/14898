The development complements Juice\u2019s accelerated growth strategy, strengthens in-house skillsets, extends service offerings, and supports growing demand for end-to-end creative service providers.<\/p>\n<p>Alan Poole, Juice Managing Director and Founder said, \u2018Truly great acquisition opportunities are pretty rare so when Jim approached me a few months back it became clear pretty quickly that their reputation, skills and stellar existing client portfolio made \u2018Frank\u2019 a natural fit for our growth plans\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Over the last few years we have built a \u2018digital-first\u2019 brand engagement agency \u2013 designing innovative ways to engage colleague and customer audiences across the online landscape. Demand for this of course has only accelerated in the last tricky couple of years and so the chance to enhance our team by bringing in \u2018Frank\u2019 and their exceptional people into Juice, whilst significantly enhancing our strategic and brand skills, was too good to pass up\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2000 \u2018Frank\u2019 has been known for delivering brand identity and campaign work for clients such as INEOS Grenadier, Dunlop and Reaction Engines. For Managing Director and Founder Jim Gilroy, the move opens exciting doors for both new and existing clients.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Juice and Frank are two businesses that \u2018just match\u2019. Over the years we have both independently built loyal client bases in the automotive, engineering and emerging technology markets. By blending our branding, strategy and creative expertise with Juice\u2019s digital production capabilities we have created an even stronger proposition for these sectors and new ones we want to enter. We\u2019ve actually worked on projects jointly in the not-too-distant past so to formalise that relationship now feels like a great move, both for the clients and the respective creative teams\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>The acquisition brings Frank team members in under the Juice umbrella and has forged a new identity for the agency.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Juice.

In a world obsessed with visual representation, consumers are becoming more and more aware of how they\u2019re being communicated to by brands.\r\n\r\nEnter Gen Viz. This psychographic (need help with that word? It\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Psychographic\">here<\/a>) macro-trend describes young teens who rely on realism, authenticity and most importantly; championing a visual-first culture. Is it not surprising then, that this generation of kids has forged ahead, constructing unique identities for themselves inspired by visual styles from the past?\r\n\r\nAs designers, we are responding to this race for realness and the struggle for ultimate authenticity. We\u2019re seeing a shift that is moving away from the \u201cnew, new\u201d backwards towards design languages of the 70s, 80s and 90s. More specifically our 80s influence today is deeply rooted in the computer-generated graphics of the era: think early Nintendo gaming systems with bright, blocky shapes.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at the how and why of this hyper-visual design trend commonly described as: \u2018Modern-Retro\u2019.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2018Walking in Memphis\u2019.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nForm and structure are two styles closely linked with art in the 80s. Think furniture design, silhouettes in fashion and gaming but specifically, think the Memphis Design movement (handy additional pictures\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/designmuseum.org\/memphis\">here<\/a>). Bright colours, cartoon-like shapes and fluid lines make up the fundamental building blocks of this artistic style, and it\u2019s back with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4683\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1620\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4683 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Bobby_Doherty_WillByrant_FB.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1620\" height=\"800\" \/> Image credit: Bobby Doherty\/New York Magazine. Facebook office, Texas, photo: Will Byrant.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the images, the resemblance between 80s object design and a modern wall mural by artist Will Byrant is striking; from the use of colour, to the shapes adopted and the playful nature of the piece.\r\n\r\n<strong>Colour Pop.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBold colours belong on screens. Again think 80s computer games and Miami Vice. More and more design is taking influence from RGB colours and translating them into poppy process versions instead. In the examples below, an advertising campaign for online dating app OKcupid, Weiden + Kennedy New York adopted an 80s aesthetic to convey a very modern message in dating culture. The visuals nod nicely to Gen Viz; with messages grounded in authenticity and personality which is largely owed to the photographic style resembling works by Guy Bourdin, notably between 1967 and 1981 when he shot\u00a0ad campaigns for shoe designer Charles Jourdan. Mysterious compositions, bright and blocky backgrounds make the output unquestionably retro and combined with central themes around online dating make for a very juxtaposing but pleasing combination.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4675\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4675 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/OKcupid_Campaign-1024x662.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"662\" \/> Image from OKcupid campaign[\/caption]\r\n\r\nColour is so important in communication. Invariably your brand will use a pre-defined palette designed to best communicate your organisation\u2019s proposition and value to its customers. But what if your message needs more vibrant hues like the example below? It\u2019s got to be OK for a brand to \u2018bend\u2019 from time-to-time and show a sense of awareness. Think long term too; how will your brand palette stack up in five or ten years time when Gen Viz become your customers, employees or partners?\r\n\r\n<strong>Layer Up.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe Modern-Retro movement employs the use of multi-faceted design, often layering shapes, images and colours together to create one visual composition. This style is popular in both print and digital applications creating impact and engagement. It also creates energy in a world of fast-paced online consumption where we want things immediately whether it be news, images, education or social updates. It\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re serving content up in an energetic way to keep up with consumption rates. Layering isn\u2019t new. But the way we\u2019re layering imagery and styles today has become more obvious, less organic and more about making a statement. Think about how you could try combining brand imagery with supplementary \u2018mood\u2019 images, for example.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4689\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4689 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Grid-Images-1024x809.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"809\" \/> Image credits: Top left and lower right: Serge Vasil for Adobe, top right: notebooks from Write & Sketch, lower left: image from Mui Mui spring summer 2018 campaign.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Science Fiction.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCue the phenomenon that is Stranger Things.\u00a0 Its 80s styling is prevalent across its use of fashion, sets, neon typography and comic book style illustrations, not to mention the blatant nod to numerous Sci-Fi films from the 80s. Would the show have worked as well without all of its nostalgic references? (No, is the answer to that question in case you didn\u2019t know). Why are so many young people engaging in a cultural era they have barely lived through, let alone remember? We\u2019re not suggesting to remake E.T. here but the point is cultural reference. The Juice designers live for persona research, it helps us to focus a design style and to select the most appropriate application for any given message. So, before you start your next project, immerse yourself (and us) in your audience\u2019s world and ask yourself, how can I make my work grab them? What points of cultural reference will make my message resonate more profoundly with my consumers?\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_4690\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-4690 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.itsjuice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/StrangerThings_Netflix_Collage_01-1024x336.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"336\" \/> Image credit: Netflix[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>That\u2019s a Wrap.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFrom fashion to material design, to pop culture and television, the 80s is definitely enjoying a revival seeping through into every aspect of design. Is this coincidence or is it a backlash to common cultural and political influences; perhaps we\u2019re just trying to lighten the mood? Or is it directly a result of Gen Viz, the group of young social activists striving for the ultimate in authenticity and living every day through a hypervisual lens? Maybe we won\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s enough just to appreciate this fun and engaging visual style, regardless of influence. You decide. And, if it\u2019s right, be brave.","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[26,11,15],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v17.5 -
